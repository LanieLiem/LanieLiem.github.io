      <p class='center'>Being an Ambassador at Dishcrawl meant putting on fun food tasting events in San Jose! My biggest project included doing a “crawl” through the Willow Glen neighborhood where foodies traveled to four different restaurants to explore different cuisines. Getting four diverse restaurants to come up with a delicious tasting menu was one thing, but it was also important to make sure there were attendees to come out to enjoy it! I publicized the event through the Dishcrawl website; I sold tickets, kepy track of attendees, and updated the event page as more information became available.

      <p class='center'> Facebook became a great outlet to advertise my events. I did mini contests on the Dishcrawl page for folks to win discounted tickets, as well as dropped clues and hints to what they might be eating. After an event, I would post photos and link viewers back to the Dishcrawl page where they could read my blog posts summarizing the evening as well as information about upcoming dishcrawls!<br>

       <p> My first Willow Glen Dishcrawl was so successful and tickets sold out so quickly that I added a repeat event, which also immediately sold out!</p>

      <p class='center'>I kept track of visitors to our Dishcrawl website, as well as to all of our social media pages by using Social Media Management & Analytics Tools, such as Hootsuite and Google Analytics. It is important to know where our ticket buyers were finding the events from. E-mails were imperative to our success, as previous attendees were the most likely to attend another Discrawl event. We got our readers excited for upcoming dishcrawls by sending out newsletters that highlighted our previous crawls and showcased the many food dishes.<br>

      <p class='center'>I worked for Invo Coconut Water's Promotions Team when they were preparing their product launch in 2014.  Our specific goal was to find the areas in San Francisco where coconut water would be consumed the most, as well as the specific clientele that would most likely purchase it. We mapped out different neighborhoods in San Francisco and scheduled out dates and times to tackle those areas. We also went to large city events such as Giants Baseball games or various marathons & races. There, we would not only hand out bottles of Invo Coconut Water, but we let them taste the product and ask for their feedback. We would compile their questions and comments and analyze them to find the best approach to find new buyers. This would also help us compare our product with similar competitors in the market. Invo ended up having a successful launch and is now found in large retail stores such as Whole Foods! </p>
