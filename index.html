    <h2 class='center'>Hello and Welcome to my Site!</h2>
<p class="center">I am currently a restaurant service worker looking to use my diverse educational and work background to seek a full-time position in San Francisco.<br><br></p>
<div class='center'><p class=''>I graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and History. During my education, I was very active in student government. I was the Chair of Oakes College within UCSC, where I overlooked a $40k budget and acted as the official link between students and faculty.<br>
I also took a semester off to study in Washington D.C. as part of the UCDC program. Here, I interned in the Office of Congressman Sam Farr. I drafted constituent letters that would reach out to entire voting districts back in California, as well as Congressional press releases and briefings on behalf of the office.<br>
I dived into the tech startup world post graduation when I joined Dishcrawl, which focused on culinary exploration. I coordinated large scale food tasting events and publicized the event through heavy social media and e-mail marketing. <br>
My love for food and drinks did not stop there. I joined the Invo Coconut Water team for their huge product launch in 2014, acting as the company’s voice, engaging with the community, and analyzing their comments, in order to develop our marketing strategies and boost our branding image. <br>
In the meantime, I took on several serving positions at various restaurants. I appreciate the hard work that goes into running a successful restaurant and wanted to be a part of the production. I love interacting with people and bringing joy through food, drinks and cheerful company. <br><br></p></div>
<p align="center">Now, I am seeking a full-time position that would propel my experiences in a productive light.<br><br>
Feel free to take a look around and please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or just want to reach out! <br><br></p>
